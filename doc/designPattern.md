Design patterns are advanced object-oriented solutions to commonly occurring software problems.
Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.
Each pattern has a name and becomes part of a vocabulary when discussing complex design solutions.	
	
The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns.
They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral (see below for a complete list).	
	
In this tutorial we provide JavaScript examples for each of the GoF patterns.
Mostly, they follow the structure and intent of the original pattern designs.
These examples demonstrate the principles behind each pattern, but are not optimized for JavaScript.	
	
JavaScript-optimized patterns are available in our Dofactory JS, a unique guide for web app developers and architects developering with JavaScript and jQuery.
Not only does it include optimized GoF patterns (using namespacing, closures, modules, immediate functions, prototypes, etc),
but also Modern Patterns, Model View Patterns, Architecture Patterns, jQuery Patterns, and more. To learn more click here.	
	
Creational Patterns	
Abstract Factory	Creates an instance of several families of classes
Builder	Separates object construction from its representation
Factory Method	Creates an instance of several derived classes
Prototype	A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
Singleton	A class of which only a single instance can exist
	
Structural Patterns	
Adapter	Match interfaces of different classes
Bridge	Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
Composite	A tree structure of simple and composite objects
Decorator	Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
Facade	A single class that represents an entire subsystem
Flyweight	A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
Proxy	An object representing another object
	
Behavioral Patterns	
Chain of Resp.	A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
Command	Encapsulate a command request as an object
Interpreter	A way to include language elements in a program
Iterator	Sequentially access the elements of a collection
Mediator	Defines simplified communication between classes
Memento	Capture and restore an object's internal state
Observer	A way of notifying change to a number of classes
State	Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
Strategy	Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
Template Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
Visitor	Defines a new operation to a class without change
