[09:22, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: it shouldn't have been
[09:26, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: the idea is to have an action method
[09:27, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: which taken in a requestModel
[09:27, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: with arguments
[09:29, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: 

1. objectModel : scope /class of method,
2.Method : method to be executed,
3. Arguments: self explanatory
4. Response : a key if present, outout is stored init
4. callback : a key if present, executes a reqModel  on current response,
5.andThen: if present for chaining of parameters in current execution

[09:30, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: this is one request Step
[09:30, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: then have a method, which can execute an array of actionStep in sequence, in parralel and nested
[09:31, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: then a wrapper function to make earlier methods async for asynchronous execution
[09:31, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: edegs cases to handled
[09:32, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: and validation of the requestModel To be added
[09:32, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: once we have 5 methods I dont think we need anything else
[09:32, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: lemme know if it makes things clearer to you
[09:33, 27/05/2021] shuya ek whatsapp: and if I am missing anything

A nested array of method ?
like 
nestedArr =
[
 [
  [method0, method1],
  [method2, method3]
 ],
 [
  [method4, method5],
  [method6, method7]
 ]
]
